/*
70. Climbing Stairs : https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

//Recursion:
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
    }
}



//Space Optimization:
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int prev = 1, curr = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int temp = curr;
            curr = prev + curr;
            prev = temp;
        }
        return curr;
    }
}
